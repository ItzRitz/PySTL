# PySTL Library
Welcome to the PySTL Library! This library is designed for educational purposes, specifically to help individuals learn and understand data structures commonly used in computer science and algorithm design. All data structures included in this library are implemented from scratch in Python. The library tries to have implementations for data structures that are present as a part of c++ standard template library

## Overview
This Python package provides a collection of basic data structures implemented in Python. The goal is to offer clear and simple implementations to aid in the study of data structures and algorithms. Each data structure is implemented from scratch, allowing users to explore and understand the underlying concepts.

## Usage
```
from pystl.structures.lists.ll import LinkedList

ll = LinkedList([1,2,3,4,5])
ll.append(10)
print(ll)
```

## Available Data Structures
LinkedList: A doubly linked list implementation.
Stack: A stack implementation using a linked list.
Queue: A queue implementation using a linked list.
Deque: A deque implementation using a linked list.
BinarySearchTree: A binary search tree implementation.
AVLTree: A AVL tree implementation.
RBTree: A red black search tree implementation.
Trie: A trie implementation.
